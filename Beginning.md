# Perspectives on Death and Meaning

For a young child, interest in philosophy probably begins with the question, "*What if after we die, nothing happens?*"  This is a question that almost everyone encounters at some point. If we cannot verifiably prove that there is a such thing as a soul, then why bother doing anything?  What is the meaning of life?

# Possible Responses to Death

There are a few possible ways a parent may respond to this imagined child:

1. Rejection. There is a soul. The existence of a soul makes death comparatively inconsequential
1. Pessimistic acceptance. The parent might agree that after we die nothing happens, and that this trivializes the pursuit of meaning
1. Optimistic acceptance. The parent likens death to the absolute end, but underscores the human's capacity to contemplate death *after* death. A commonly cited point is that humans don't grieve for the time before they were born. After death, they cannot comprehend being dead. Eternity is less than an instant.
1. None of the above. The parent shies away from this heavy question and teases the child with the philosophical question of whether a hotdog is a sandwich

# What is the Meaning of Life?

Should the parent choose to respond to this imagined child with any of the first three options, then the natural follow-up is what the point of all of this is. This is where things get interesting, as there are a few primary schools of thought in philosophy:

1. There is absolutely, 100% no meaning of life. There is no answer. 
1. There might be an answer, but what really matters is the meaning we create for ourselves.
1. There is a divorce between our human desire to find meaning and the actual meaninglessness of the universe. The best course of action is to embrace a religion (kierkegaard)
1. There is a divorce between our human desire to find meaning and the actual meaninglessness of the universe, but religion itself represents a "philosophical suicide" in that it rejects philosophy over a belief system that is divorced from logic and reason (Camus)
1. You should stop asking questions and pay more attention to our Nutribullet. You can make a smoothie in it, then drink the smoothie out of the same cup you used to make the smoothie.

# Why Philosophy Matters

The same way that physics finds direct applications in math, fiction writing directly applies philosophy to make compelling works of fiction.  Camus and Sartre were not just brilliant philosophers, but brilliant fiction writers as well whose fictional works served as thought experiments.

This is not just true of classic fiction. TV series such as the absurdist *Bojack Horseman* constantly give a nod to their philosophical influences, such as in one character's reference to Camus' oft-cited *Myth of Sisyphus*. *The Good Place* is probably the best example of how a modern media continues to explore philosophical ideas instead of keeping them confined to the classroom.


# A Roadmap

This github section will hopefully, as the days or months progress, serve as a kind of central hub for examinations of timeless philosophers such as Descartes, Rousseau, Dan Harmon, and Jaden Smith. They also may later serve as filter content for a test of Jekyll, which seems like a totally badass solution to a lot of the problems of other web frameworks.

This github section will also, if time (and attention span) allow, attempt to draw connections between these ancient philosophers and the modern world of technology, software, modern American politics, and Jaden Smith's Twitter.

What I hope to demonstrate (if anything)

1. That absurdism is the most compelling philosophy, regardless of whether or not it is the "best"
1. That philosophy and religion do not have to be divorced, as demonstrated by Kierkegaard, CS Lewis, and that one surprisingly insightful Twitter. That being said, there are great philosophers who reject religion, and great philosophers who embrace it - both have valid points that require exploration.
1. That standard markdown is easier to format than Tumblr
1. That if you can convince yourself to be continually impressed by how your Nutribullet allows you to drink a smoothie out of the same cup you used to make the smoothie, you have a wisdom that goes far beyond the norm
